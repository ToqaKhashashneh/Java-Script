        <!-- Note to myself:
            HTML
        1) i added the select elemnt 
        2) i gave it an id called "select" to call it in Js 
        3) i made an inline event which is "on change" that triggers the change on the select options
           and i made a function called "ChangeFlags"
        4) i gave each option a value to use it later
        5) i added the img elemnt with an empty src which is basically for displaying the flag images and gave it an id called "img"
            Java Script
        6) on the Change Flags Function i called the select by it id and stored it in a const called "datalist" to work on it on Js
           i also stored the values of the datalist which are (Jordan,Palestine and Lebanon) that i gave it to the options in step (4)
           in a const called "country"
        7) i called the img elemnt by it id and stored it in a const called "flags" to work on it on Js
        8) i made an object called "images" and stored it in a const which contains (key:value) for each option
           in this case the key was the value i gave to the option earlier and the value was the img src for each option
        9) finally i assigned each option (img src) to the (img elemnt src in html which is for the display in the 1st place)
            based on the selected datalist value (option value) by the key on the images object

            <option value="Jordan">Jordan </option>
            <option value="Palestine">Palestine </option>
            <option value="Lebanon">Lebanon </option>

        </select>

        <img src="" id="img" alt="photo">


        <script>
            
            function ChangeFlags() {
            const datalist = document.getElementById("selectCountry");
            const country = datalist.value; 

            let flags = document.getElementById("img");

            let images = {Jordan: "Jordan.jpg", Palestine: "Palestine.jpg", Lebanon: "Lebanon.jpg",};
            flags.src = images[country];
            }
